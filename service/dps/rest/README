Metadata and Content Service REST API.

This application should be deployed on servlet container and has been tested on Tomcat 7.0.
Default profile uses in-memory implementation of services. 

In order to use Cassandra/S3/Solr services, the application must be built with "persistent" profile.
This implementation relies on external services and all connection details must be provided as jndi properties in Tomcat. 
See META-INF/context.xml for a list of properties that are used by the application in persistent mode.

'indexing.properties' file should be added to containers lib directory. If not, task submission for indexing topology
will not clear desired datasets from solr and mongo.
